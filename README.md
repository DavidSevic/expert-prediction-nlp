# Expert Prediction with Sentence Classification

This project explores different approaches for sentence-level classification in the context of expert prediction. Given noisy, AI-generated error descriptions and associated expert IDs, the goal is to identify the top K most relevant experts for a given input.

The focus of the project is not on achieving high classification accuracy, but on experimenting with diverse modeling techniques, demonstrating understanding of NLP workflows, and showcasing creativity in approach.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `project.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the full implementation, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and detailed explanations.
- `project.pdf`: PDF version of the notebook with all cells executed and outputs visible, suitable for easy viewing or printing.
- `data.csv`: Multilingual dataset of error descriptions and expert IDs.
- `data_eng.csv`: English-only subset of the original data, used in parts of the analysis.

## üí° Notes

- The data used is entirely **AI-generated and randomized**.
- Multiple modeling techniques were evaluated, including traditional statistical models and transformer-based autoencoder approaches.
- This project was conducted as an exercise in NLP modeling and experimentation.
